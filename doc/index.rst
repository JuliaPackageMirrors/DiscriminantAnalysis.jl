Discriminant Analysis
=====================

**DiscriminantAnalysis.jl** is a Julia package for multiple linear and quadratic 
regularized discriminant analysis (LDA & QDA respectively). LDA and QDA are
distribution-based classifiers that make the (strong) assumption that the 
underlying data follows a multivariate normal distribution. LDA is distinct from
QDA in the assumption about the class variability; LDA assumes that all classes 
have the same variance whereas QDA allows each class to have its own covariance
matrix. This results in LDA being a linear classifier and QDA being a quadratic
classifier.
